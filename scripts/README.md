# Scripts

This directory contains various shell scripts for managing configurations, automating tasks, and providing helper functionalities for the desktop environment.

## Subdirectories

*   `config/`: **For Developers:** Contains scripts that **generate or update** the actual configuration files (e.g., for Alacritty, Hyprland, Waybar) that are stored/committed within this repository. These are generally **not** run by end-users during the normal setup process. For detailed information on using these developer-focused scripts, see `scripts/config/README.md`.
*   `config_lib/`: Contains library scripts with common shell functions used by the configuration generation scripts in `config/`. This promotes code reuse and modularity.
*   `setup_lib/`: Contains library scripts with functions used by the main `../setup.sh` script (located in the repository root). These scripts handle tasks for the end-user setup, such as:
    *   Backing up existing files (`backup.sh`).
    *   Installing dependencies (`dependencies.sh`).
    *   Performing file system operations like creating directories and symlinks (`fs_ops.sh`).
    *   Git-related operations (`git_ops.sh`).
    *   User interface utilities for the setup script (e.g., prompts, messages) (`ui.sh`).

## Individual Scripts

Any scripts directly within this `scripts/` directory (if any) would be general-purpose utilities not fitting into the `config` or `setup_lib` categories. (Currently, it seems most scripts are organized into the subdirectories).

## Usage

*   **Configuration Generation Scripts (`config/`)**: As mentioned above, these are primarily for developers. Refer to `scripts/config/README.md` for their usage. End-users will use the configurations generated by these scripts, which are already included in the repository.
*   **Library Scripts (`config_lib/`, `setup_lib/`)**: These are not meant to be run directly. They provide functions sourced by other scripts.
*   **Main Setup Script (`../setup.sh`)**: The primary entry point for end-users to set up the dotfiles is the `setup.sh` script in the repository root. This script utilizes the helper libraries in `setup_lib/` to copy the pre-generated configuration files to your system (e.g., into `~/.config/`).

## Customization

*   **For End-Users:** Customization of the behavior or appearance of applications (Hyprland, Alacritty, etc.) should be done by editing the configuration files in your `~/.config/` directory *after* running the main `../setup.sh` script.
*   **For Developers/Contributors:** If you need to modify how the base configuration files *within this repository* are generated, or how the initial setup process works, you'll need to edit the scripts within these subdirectories:
    *   To change the setup process (e.g., new dependencies, backup locations), explore `setup_lib/` and the main `../setup.sh`.
    *   To change how the configuration files themselves are generated (e.g., altering default settings in `alacritty.toml` or `hyprland.conf`), explore the relevant scripts in `config/` (and see its `README.md`).
    *   For new shared functionality for config generation, consider `config_lib/common.sh`.

Always be cautious when modifying shell scripts, and ensure you understand the commands being executed, especially those requiring `sudo` permissions or performing file system modifications.
