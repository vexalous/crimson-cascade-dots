# Waybar Configuration

This directory contains the styling (`style.css`) for the Waybar status bar and a **placeholder** for its main configuration file (`config`).

**Important:** The actual `config` file, which defines all modules and their settings, is **generated by the `scripts/config/waybar_config.sh` script**. The `setup.sh` script (from the repository root) copies this *generated* version to `~/.config/waybar/config`. The `config` file in this directory is minimal and not the one used in the final setup.

## Key Features & Modules

The Waybar setup provided by these dotfiles is designed for a clean and informative status bar, matching the overall visual theme (fonts, colors, icons). Key modules configured (in the generated `config`) include:

*   **Left Modules:**
    *   `hyprland/workspaces`: Displays Hyprland workspaces with custom icons.
    *   `hyprland/mode`: Shows the current Hyprland mode (e.g., resize).
*   **Center Modules:**
    *   `hyprland/window`: Displays the title of the active window, with rewrites for common applications to show icons.
*   **Right Modules:**
    *   `pulseaudio`: Volume control with icons.
    *   `network`: Network status (Wi-Fi ESSID or Ethernet status).
    *   `cpu`: CPU usage.
    *   `memory`: Memory usage.
    *   `clock`: Current time, with date on hover/alternate format.
    *   `tray`: System tray for application icons.
    *   `custom/power`: A power menu button invoking a Rofi script.

## Files

*   `config` (Placeholder): A minimal JSON file. The **actual configuration is generated by `scripts/config/waybar_config.sh`** and placed in `~/.config/waybar/config` during setup. This generated file defines the modules, their order, alignment, and specific settings (format strings, icons, click actions).
*   `style.css`: This file contains the CSS rules used to style Waybar and its modules. It customizes fonts, colors, backgrounds, margins, padding, borders, and icon styles to align with the dotfiles' theme.

## Customization

After running the main `setup.sh` script, you can customize Waybar by editing the files in `~/.config/waybar/`:

1.  **Editing `config` (in `~/.config/waybar/`)**:
    *   To add, remove, or reorder modules, modify the `modules-left`, `modules-center`, or `modules-right` arrays in the JSON structure.
    *   To change a module's behavior, find its entry (e.g., "clock", "network") and adjust its properties.
    *   For a comprehensive list of modules and their configuration options, consult the [Waybar Wiki](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Configuration).

2.  **Editing `style.css` (in `~/.config/waybar/`)**:
    *   To change visual appearance, modify CSS rules. You can target Waybar itself (`#waybar`) or specific modules (e.g., `#clock`, `#network`, `#custom-power`).
    *   Refer to the [Waybar Wiki on Styling](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Styling) for guidance.

## Applying Changes

Waybar typically reloads automatically when its configuration file (`~/.config/waybar/config`) or stylesheet (`~/.config/waybar/style.css`) is saved. If it doesn't, or for immediate effect:

*   You can manually trigger a reload by sending a `SIGUSR2` signal: `killall -SIGUSR2 waybar`
*   Alternatively, restart Waybar. Check `hypr/conf/execs.conf` for how it's launched (usually just `waybar &`).

If you are a developer looking to change the *base* configuration generated by the scripts, you should modify `scripts/config/waybar_config.sh` and then re-run it to update the `waybar/config` file within the repository.
