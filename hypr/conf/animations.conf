    # --- Grouped/Tabbed Window Animations (Examples - uncomment and adjust if you use window grouping) ---
    # animation = groups, 1, 4, responsive, slide           # Animation for group operations like adding/removing windows
    # animation = groupSwitch, 1, 3, responsive, fade       # Animation when switching active window within a group (e.g., tabbing)
