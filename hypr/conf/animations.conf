# --- Animations Configuration ---
animations {
    enabled = true

    # Optional: Test this for your specific hardware.
    # prefer_hw_renderer = true

    # --- Window Animations ---
    # Aim for a feeling of directness and refinement.
    animation = windows, 1, 6, fluentEntry, popin 75%       # General window actions: slightly longer, refined pop
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 5, subtleArrival, popin 65%   # Windows appearing with a polished 'arrival'
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 5, fluentExit, popin 75%     # Windows disappearing decisively
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 4, responsiveDirect         # Extremely responsive dragging/resizing

    # --- Border Animations ---
    # Subtle and not distracting.
    animation = border, 1, 12, gentleFlow                   # Smooth, slightly longer for color/active transitions
    # animation = borderangle, 1, 70, linear, loop          # Example: Very slow, continuous subtle gradient shift if desired
    animation = borderangle, 1, 20, gentleFlow              # Non-looping, smooth gradient angle transition

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # Quick, clean, and unobtrusive.
    animation = fade, 1, 4, responsiveDirect                # Parent for fades, quick
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 4, responsiveDirect              # e.g., for layers if not using popin
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 4, responsiveDirect
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 3, responsiveDirect          # Very quick for active/inactive window visual changes
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 6, gentleFlow                   # Softer dimming for inactive windows

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    # Clear, fluid, providing good spatial feedback.
    animation = workspaces, 1, 6, gentleFlow, slidefade 25% # Slightly longer duration for smoother feel
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 6, gentleFlow, slidefadevert 25% # Consistent with normal workspaces

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, etc.) ---
    # Should appear and disappear gracefully but quickly.
    animation = layers, 1, 5, subtleArrival, popin 70%      # Default for layers, using the 'arrival' effect
    animation = layersIn, 1, 4, quickPop, popin 60%         # Quick, lively appearance for notifications/menus
    animation = layersOut, 1, 4, fluentExit, popin 70%      # Clean exit for layers

    # --- Grouped/Tabbed Window Animations (Examples - uncomment and adjust if you use window grouping) ---
    # animation = groups, 1, 5, fluentEntry, slide
    # animation = groupSwitch, 1, 4, responsiveDirect, fade
    # animation = groupMinimize, 1, 5, fluentExit, popin 60%
