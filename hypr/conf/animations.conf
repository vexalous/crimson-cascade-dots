# Hyprland Configuration

# PLEASE NOTE: This is a PARTIAL configuration focusing on animations.
# You will need to have other essential Hyprland settings for a complete setup
# (e.g., monitor, input, windowrules, keybindings, exec-once, etc.).

# -----------------------------------------------------
# --- Bezier Curves - "Fluid & Purposeful" Theme ---
# These MUST be defined globally, BEFORE the animations { } block.
# -----------------------------------------------------
bezier = responsiveUI, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 1.0
bezier = gentleEase, 0.35, 0, 0.25, 1
bezier = subtlePop, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, 1
bezier = exitCurve, 0.6, 0.1, 0.9, 0.3
bezier = workspaceSwipe, 0.2, 0.75, 0.15, 0.95
# bezier = linear, 0,0,1,1 # Usually not needed if other curves are well-defined

# -----------------------------------------------------
# --- Animations Configuration ---
# -----------------------------------------------------
animations {
    enabled = true

    # Optional: Consider if issues arise, but generally not needed to be forced.
    # prefer_hw_renderer = false # Default is often best. Test if you experience issues.

    # --- Window Animations ---
    # Windows appearing: A clear but gentle slide from a short distance, combined with a smooth fade.
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 6, gentleEase, slide up 10%
    # Windows disappearing: A decisive exit.
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 5, exitCurve, slide down 10%
    # General window operations (maximize, tile changes, etc.): Subtle and quick.
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 3, responsiveUI # Covers dragging, resizing. Curve only, no specific style needed here.
    animation = windows, 1, 4, gentleEase        # For other changes like fullscreen, tiling adjustments.
                                                 # Using a gentle curve without an explicit style will fade/transform smoothly.

    # --- Border Animations ---
    # Active/inactive border color changes should be noticeable but not jarring.
    animation = border, 1, 8, gentleEase
    animation = borderangle, 1, 15, gentleEase # For gradient transitions if used.

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # Crucial for smoothing transitions, especially with slide animations.
    # `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` will be implicitly used by `windowsIn`/`Out` if they don't define their own opacity change.
    # However, we define them explicitly for clarity and control, especially for layers or other fade needs.
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 5, gentleEase    # Matches or slightly leads window slide-in.
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 4, exitCurve    # Matches or slightly leads window slide-out.
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 2, responsiveUI # For very quick opacity changes (e.g., dimming)
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 7, gentleEase   # Smooth dimming of inactive windows.

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    # Should be very fluid and provide clear spatial orientation.
    # `slidefade` provides a nice balance of movement and opacity change.
    animation = workspaces, 1, 6, workspaceSwipe, slidefade 30%
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 6, workspaceSwipe, slidefadevert 30%

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, Overlays) ---
    # Layers should appear and disappear promptly without being obtrusive.
    animation = layersIn, 1, 4, subtlePop, popin 40%  # Gentle, quick pop for menus/notifications.
    animation = layersOut, 1, 4, exitCurve, popin 60% # Clear exit for layers.
    # animation = layers, 1, 5, subtlePop # Fallback for layers if In/Out not specific enough.
}
