    # prefer_hw_renderer = true # Optional: If you have a decent GPU, might offer smoother results. Test this.

    # --- Global Animation Settings ---
    # These are fallbacks if specific animations aren't defined.
    # Consider a slightly faster default speed.
    # animation = global, 1, 5, default # Example, often overridden

    # --- Window Animations ---
    # Aim for responsiveness and clarity.
    animation = windows, 1, 5, fluentEntry, popin 80%      # General window actions (spawn, initial move)
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 4, fluentEntry, popin 60%     # Windows appearing - slightly quicker
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 4, fluentExit, popin 80%     # Windows disappearing - quick exit
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 5, responsive              # For dragging/resizing - should feel very direct

    # --- Border Animations ---
    animation = border, 1, 10, gentleSwipe                 # Smooth, not too jarring color/width changes
    # borderangle: Reconsider if loop is truly necessary due to performance. [1]
    # If kept, make it subtle or faster if it's meant to be an active visual element.
    # animation = borderangle, 1, 60, linear, loop # Example: Very slow, continuous subtle shift (if you *must* loop)
    animation = borderangle, 1, 15, gentleSwipe # Faster, more of a transition effect if not looping

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # Used for opacity changes. Should be quick and clean.
    animation = fade, 1, 3, responsive           # Parent for fades
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 3, responsive         # e.g. for new windows if not using popin, or for layer fades
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 3, responsive
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 2, responsive     # Very quick for active/inactive window dimming
    # animation = fadeShadow, 1, 4, responsive   # If you have shadows that animate
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 5, gentleSwipe       # For dimming inactive windows, slightly softer

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    # Should be clear and provide good spatial feedback.
    # 'slidefade' often feels more polished than a plain 'slide'.
    animation = workspaces, 1, 5, gentleSwipe, slidefade 30% # Smooth but not overly slow, with a subtle fade
    # Consider a slightly different feel for special workspaces if you use them distinctly.
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 5, gentleSwipe, slidefadevert 30% # Vertical version

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, etc.) ---
    # These often benefit from being quick and to the point.
    animation = layers, 1, 4, fluentEntry, popin 80%        # Default for layers
    animation = layersIn, 1, 3, fastPop, popin 70%          # Quick appearance for notifications/menus
    animation = layersOut, 1, 3, fluentExit, popin 80%      # Quick disappearance

    # --- Grouped/Tabbed Window Animations (if you use groups extensively) ---
    # animation = groups, 1, 4, responsive, slide
    # animation = groupSwitch, 1, 3, responsive, fade # Fading between tabs in a group
    # animation = groupMinimize, 1, 4, fluentExit, popin 50%
