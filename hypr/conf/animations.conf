# Hyprland Configuration

# PLEASE NOTE: This is a PARTIAL configuration focusing on animations.
# You will need to have other essential Hyprland settings for a complete setup
# (e.g., monitor, input, windowrules, keybindings, exec-once, etc.).

# -----------------------------------------------------
# --- Bezier Curves - "Fluid & Purposeful" Theme ---
# These MUST be defined globally, BEFORE the animations { } block.
# -----------------------------------------------------
bezier = responsiveUI, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 1.0
bezier = gentleEase, 0.35, 0, 0.25, 1
bezier = subtlePop, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, 1
bezier = exitCurve, 0.6, 0.1, 0.9, 0.3
bezier = workspaceSwipe, 0.2, 0.75, 0.15, 0.95
# bezier = linear, 0,0,1,1

# --- Animations Configuration ---
# -----------------------------------------------------
animations {
    enabled = true

    # prefer_hw_renderer = false

    # --- Window Animations ---
    # Windows appearing: Grow from the center.
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 5, subtlePop, popin 0% # Changed to popin 0% for "grow from center"
    
    # Windows disappearing: A decisive exit (slide down).
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 5, exitCurve, slide down 10%
    
    # General window operations (maximize, tile changes, etc.): Subtle and quick.
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 3, responsiveUI
    animation = windows, 1, 4, gentleEase

    # --- Border Animations ---
    animation = border, 1, 8, gentleEase
    animation = borderangle, 1, 15, gentleEase

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # fadeIn is still important for windowsIn to smoothly become opaque.
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 5, gentleEase    # Duration matches windowsIn
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 4, exitCurve    # Matches or slightly leads window slide-out.
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 2, responsiveUI
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 7, gentleEase

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    animation = workspaces, 1, 6, workspaceSwipe, slidefade 30%
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 6, workspaceSwipe, slidefadevert 30%

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, Overlays) ---
    animation = layersIn, 1, 4, subtlePop, popin 40%
    animation = layersOut, 1, 4, exitCurve, popin 60%
