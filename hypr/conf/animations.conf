# Hyprland Configuration

# PLEASE NOTE: This is a PARTIAL configuration focusing on animations.
# You will need to have other essential Hyprland settings for a complete setup
# (e.g., monitor, input, windowrules, keybindings, exec-once, etc.).

# -----------------------------------------------------
# --- Custom Bezier Curves - "Polished & Substantial" Theme ---
# These MUST be defined globally, BEFORE the animations { } block.
# -----------------------------------------------------
bezier = smoothInOut, 0.42, 0, 0.58, 1
bezier = gentleArrival, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4, 0.95
bezier = directResponse, 0.1, 0.8, 0.15, 0.95
bezier = flowTransition, 0.35, 0.2, 0.15, 0.9
bezier = crispPop, 0.15, 0.9, 0.2, 1
bezier = linear, 0,0,1,1

# --- Animations Configuration ---
# -----------------------------------------------------
animations {
    enabled = true

    # Optional: Test for your hardware.
    # prefer_hw_renderer = true

    # --- Window Animations ---
    animation = windows, 1, 7, smoothInOut, slide down 3% # General window operations (e.g. maximize, tile changes)
                                                          # Using a subtle slide for general changes
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 7, gentleArrival, slide up 5% # Windows appearing: gentle slide from bottom
                                                            # Relies on 'fadeIn' for opacity change
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 6, smoothInOut, slide down 5% # Windows disappearing: smooth slide out
                                                             # Relies on 'fadeOut' for opacity
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 3, directResponse           # Extremely responsive dragging/resizing (no style needed, just curve)

    # --- Border Animations ---
    animation = border, 1, 15, smoothInOut                   # Longer, very smooth border color/active transitions
    # animation = borderangle, 1, 70, linear, loop
    animation = borderangle, 1, 25, smoothInOut              # Non-looping, smooth gradient angle transition

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # These are crucial when windowsIn/Out use slide without inherent fade.
    animation = fade, 1, 6, smoothInOut                     # Parent for fades, slightly longer for smoothness
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 6, smoothInOut                   # For windows appearing and other fade-in events
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 5, smoothInOut                  # For windows closing
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 3, directResponse            # Quick for active/inactive window visual changes
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 8, smoothInOut                  # Very smooth, slightly longer dimming for inactive windows

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    animation = workspaces, 1, 7, flowTransition, slidefade 20% # Even smoother, slightly longer workspace glide
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 7, flowTransition, slidefadevert 20%

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, etc.) ---
    animation = layers, 1, 6, gentleArrival, popin 60%      # Layers appearing with a gentle, cushioned pop
    animation = layersIn, 1, 5, crispPop, popin 50%         # Notifications/menus: quick, crisp pop
    animation = layersOut, 1, 5, smoothInOut, popin 60%     # Layers disappearing smoothly

    # --- Grouped/Tabbed Window Animations (Examples) ---
    # animation = groups, 1, 6, smoothInOut, slide
    # animation = groupSwitch, 1, 4, directResponse, fade
    # animation = groupMinimize, 1, 6, smoothInOut, popin 50%
