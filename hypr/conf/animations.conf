# Hyprland Configuration

# PLEASE NOTE: This is a PARTIAL configuration focusing on animations.
# You will need to have other essential Hyprland settings for a complete setup
# (e.g., monitor, input, windowrules, keybindings, exec-once, etc.).

# -----------------------------------------------------
# --- Custom Bezier Curves for Animations ---
# These MUST be defined globally, BEFORE the animations { } block.
# Values for P1Y and P2Y are kept within 0.0-1.0 for robust parsing.
# -----------------------------------------------------
bezier = fluentEntry, 0.2, 0.85, 0.15, 1
bezier = fluentExit, 0.7, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2
bezier = responsiveDirect, 0.05, 0.9, 0.1, 1
bezier = gentleFlow, 0.35, 0, 0.25, 1
bezier = quickPop, 0.1, 0.85, 0.2, 1.0       # Y value capped at 1.0 for stability
bezier = subtleArrival, 0.2, 0.95, 0.6, 1    # P1Y capped at <=1.0 for stability
bezier = linear, 0,0,1,1                     # Standard linear curve

# --- Animations Configuration ---
# -----------------------------------------------------
animations {
    enabled = true

    # Optional: Test this for your specific hardware.
    # Enabling this might offload rendering to the GPU, potentially improving smoothness
    # on systems with capable GPUs, but can sometimes cause issues. Test with it on and off.
    # prefer_hw_renderer = true

    # --- Window Animations ---
    # Defines how windows animate on creation, deletion, and movement.
    animation = windows, 1, 6, fluentEntry, popin 75%       # General window actions (spawn, initial move)
    animation = windowsIn, 1, 5, subtleArrival, popin 65%   # Windows appearing with a polished 'arrival'
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 5, fluentExit, popin 75%     # Windows disappearing decisively
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 4, responsiveDirect         # Extremely responsive dragging/resizing

    # --- Border Animations ---
    # Animates changes to border colors or thickness.
    animation = border, 1, 12, gentleFlow                   # Smooth, slightly longer for color/active transitions
    
    # 'borderangle' animates the gradient angle of borders.
    # Looping 'borderangle' can be resource-intensive. Use with caution.
    # To enable, uncomment the line below and comment out the non-looping one.
    # animation = borderangle, 1, 70, linear, loop          # Example: Very slow, continuous subtle gradient shift
    animation = borderangle, 1, 20, gentleFlow              # A non-looping, smooth transition effect for gradient angle

    # --- Fade Animations ---
    # Controls how opacity changes for various elements.
    animation = fade, 1, 4, responsiveDirect                # Parent for all fade animations, quick
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 4, responsiveDirect              # e.g., for layers if not using popin, or for window spawn if preferred over popin
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 4, responsiveDirect             # Fade out for closing windows or layers
    animation = fadeSwitch, 1, 3, responsiveDirect          # Very quick fade for active/inactive window visual changes (e.g. dimming)
    animation = fadeDim, 1, 6, gentleFlow                   # Softer dimming for inactive windows (e.g., with `decoration:dim_inactive`)

    # --- Workspace Animations ---
    # How switching between workspaces is animated.
    animation = workspaces, 1, 6, gentleFlow, slidefade 25% # Smooth slide with a subtle fade; 25% is the slide distance
    
    # Animation for special workspaces (e.g., scratchpads).
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 6, gentleFlow, slidefadevert 25% # Vertical slidefade for special workspaces

    # --- Layer Animations (Notifications, Menus, Overlays) ---
    # How elements like notifications, application menus, or overlays animate.
    animation = layers, 1, 5, subtleArrival, popin 70%      # Default for layers, using the 'arrival' effect
    animation = layersIn, 1, 4, quickPop, popin 60%         # Quick, lively appearance for notifications/menus
    animation = layersOut, 1, 4, fluentExit, popin 70%      # Clean exit for layers

    # --- Grouped/Tabbed Window Animations (Examples - uncomment and adjust if you use window grouping) ---
    # These animations apply if you use Hyprland's window grouping features.
    # animation = groups, 1, 5, fluentEntry, slide           # Animation for group operations like adding/removing windows
    # animation = groupSwitch, 1, 4, responsiveDirect, fade  # Animation when switching active window within a group (e.g., tabbing)
    # animation = groupMinimize, 1, 5, fluentExit, popin 60% # Animation for minimizing a group (if applicable)
}

# Add your other Hyprland configurations below (monitors, input, binds, rules, etc.)
# For example:
# monitor=,preferred,auto,1
# exec-once = waybar &
# input {
# kb_layout = us
# follow_mouse = 1
# }
# general {
# layout = dwindle
# }
# ... and so on.
