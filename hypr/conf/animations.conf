# Hyprland Configuration

# PLEASE NOTE: This is a PARTIAL configuration focusing on animations.
# You will need to have other essential Hyprland settings for a complete setup
# (e.g., monitor, input, windowrules, keybindings, exec-once, etc.).

# --- Bezier Curves - "Fluid & Purposeful" Theme ---
# These MUST be defined globally, BEFORE the animations { } block.
