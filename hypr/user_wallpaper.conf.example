# Example configuration for user-defined wallpaper in Hyprland (via hyprpaper.sh script)
#
# To use this, copy this file to 'user_wallpaper.conf' in the same directory
# (e.g., ~/.config/hypr/user_wallpaper.conf) and uncomment the 'wallpaper_path' line.
#
# Replace the example path with the actual path to your desired wallpaper image.
# The setup script will automatically set a default wallpaper. Use this file to override it after setup, or create this file as 'user_wallpaper.conf' in the same directory (~/.config/hypr/) before running setup if you wish to use a custom wallpaper from the beginning.
# You can use '~' for your home directory.

# wallpaper_path = ~/Pictures/my_favorite_wallpaper.jpg
# wallpaper_path = /usr/share/backgrounds/another_wallpaper.png
